The U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional republic and
liberal democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and
judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of
Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper
house based on equal representation for each state. Substantial autonomy is
given to states and several territories, with a political culture that
emphasizes liberty, equality under the law, individualism, and limited
government.
