ONCE there were four children whose names were Peter,
Susan, Edmund and Lucy. This story is about something
that happened to them when they were sent away from
London during the war because of the air-raids. They were
sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the
country, ten miles from the nearest railway station and two miles from
the nearest post office.
